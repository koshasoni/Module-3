     <p>I love using the five-paragraph model for writing. I can find three points to argue for or exemplify just about
any topic imaginable. Cats are good pets because they’re good companions, they’re clean, and they’re easy to
care for. Jaws is a classic film because of its acting, its cinematography, and its musical score. Three examples
of the U.S. government’s checks and balances are its executive branch, its legislative branch, and its judicial
branches. The five-paragraph model is a valuable tool for many writing situations because it structures my
writing, it aids my readers, and it is versatile.One advantage of the five-paragraph model is that it structures what I write. Before I learned the five-paragraph
recipe, I’d either stare at a blank screen or I’d write one big block of text; now, I know to first identify three
examples, reasons, or other supporting pieces of evidence. Then, I develop those three examples, reasons, or
pieces of evidence into its own paragraph. I write a thesis statement based off those three examples, reasons, or
pieces of evidence; I flesh out my introduction with a hook; and I write a conclusion paragraph. Following the
five-paragraph model makes my writing tasks considerably less intimidating.
A related advantage of the five-paragraph model is that my following the recipe makes it easy for readers to
follow my writing. When readers see five paragraphs (not one block of text), they can anticipate that I’ll
introduce my topic in my first paragraph and that I’ll conclude my first paragraph with my thesis statement.
Readers can predict that I’ll provide three examples, reasons, or other supporting evidence to support my thesis
statement, each of which will be fleshed out in its own paragraph: boom, boom, boom. And readers know
they’ll find my conclusions in my final, fifth paragraph. By using the five-paragraph model, I ease the burden
on my readers.
A third advantage of the five-paragraph model is that, like most recipes, it can be doubled or even tripled. For a
standard 400 to 500-word paper, I apply the standard single batch of the recipe, writing 75 to 100 words in each
of the five paragraphs. For a 1000-word essay, I double the recipe writing by two paragraphs, rather than only
one, for the introduction, the three supporting paragraphs, and the conclusion paragraph. I can even write a
5000-word paper with this recipe (by writing 1000 words for each of the five components). The five-paragraph
model is versatile for all my writing needs.
It’s obvious. I’m clearly a fan of the five-paragraph model. As long as I’m able to outline three reasons why
Psychology is my favorite subject, three arguments why Pulp Fiction is better than Forrest Gump, and three
examples of how Shakespeare’s works are relevant to current day society, I can write just about any analytical
essay. The five-paragraph model is truly a valuable tool. I wished my life was as well structured, versatile, and
easy to follow as the five-paragraph model.I love using the five-paragraph model for writing. I can find three points to argue for or exemplify just about
